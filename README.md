# Anti-Foosball Foosball Club (AFFC)

All code-related resources for Olin College's [Anti-Foosball Foosball Club][affc] (AFFC), an organization dedicated to improving Olin's foosball table. Our current project is _Operation Autofoos_, who's goal is to setup automatic scoring for the West Hall foosball table.

Please contact Ari Porad, Aaron Blust, Jermey Wenger, Esme Abbot, or Grant Goodall if you have any questions or want to participate! None of us have any idea what we're doing, so we're always looking for new people to help out. You can also see [our club charter][charter].
