# Project Autofoos

A work in progress attempt to setup automatic scoring for Olin's West Hall foosball table.

Please contact Ari Porad, Aaron Blust, Jermey Wenger, Esme Abbot, or Grant Goodall if you have any questions or want to participate! None of us have any idea what we're doing, so we're always looking for new people to help out.
